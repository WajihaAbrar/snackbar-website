      <p>
        A snack bar is often a small food shop situated on the streets of town.
        Besides soft drinks, candies and chewing gum, some snack bars sell
        hamburgers, french fries, potato chips, corn chips and other foods.
        While this is usually the case, sometimes "snack bar" refers to a small
        caf√© or cafeteria. Various small, casual dining establishments may be
        called "snack bars", including beverage and snack counters at movie
        theaters, and small delis.
